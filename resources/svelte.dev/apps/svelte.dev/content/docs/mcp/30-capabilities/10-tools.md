The following tools are provided by the MCP server to the model you are using, which can decide to call one or more of them during a session:

## list-sections

Provides a list of all the available documentation sections.

## get-documentation

Allows the model to get the full (and up-to-date) documentation for the requested sections directly from [svelte.dev/docs](/docs).

## svelte-autofixer

Uses static analysis to provide suggestions for code that your LLM generates. It can be invoked in an agentic loop by your model until all issues and suggestions are resolved.

## playground-link

Generates an ephemeral playground link with the generated code. It's useful when the generated code is not written to a file in your project and you want to quickly test the generated solution. The code is not stored anywhere except the URL itself (which will often, as a consequence, be quite large).

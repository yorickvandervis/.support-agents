The open source [repository](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp) containing the code for the MCP server is also a Claude Code Marketplace plugin.

The marketplace allow you to install the `svelte` plugin which will give you both the remote MCP server, a [skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) to instruct the LLM on how to properly write Svelte 5 code, and a specialized agent for editing Svelte files.

If possible is recommended to instruct the LLM to execute MCP calls with the agent (you can explicitly mention an agent in your message to delegate work to it) when creating or editing `.svelte` files or `.svelte.ts`/`.svelte.js` modules as it helps save context by handling Svelte-specific tasks more efficiently.

## Installation

To add the repository as a marketplace launch claude code and type

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sveltejs/mcp
```

once you do that you can install the svelte skill doing

```bash
/plugin install svelte
```

description: Get up to date information about Drizzle ORM
---

You have access to the Drizzle ORM documentation and source code at `~/.support-agents/resources/drizzle-orm`.

Use this codebase to provide accurate, up-to-date information about Drizzle ORM, schema definitions, queries, migrations, and related tools.

When you are searching the codebase, be very careful that you do not read too much at once. Only read a small amount at a time as you're searching, avoid reading dozens of files at once...

For when you're outputting code in the chat:

- Always use TypeScript for code examples
- Include comments explaining what each piece does
- Prefer practical examples over theoretical explanations

description: Get up to date information about OpenCode
---

You have access to the OpenCode documentation and source code at `~/.support-agents/resources/opencode`.

Use this codebase to provide accurate, up-to-date information about OpenCode features, commands, agents, and development.

When you are searching the codebase, be very careful that you do not read too much at once. Only read a small amount at a time as you're searching, avoid reading dozens of files at once...

It's Advent of Svelte time!

This year, we're doing something different: every day between now and Christmas, a new door will be unlocked on [advent.sveltesociety.dev/2025](https://advent.sveltesociety.dev/2025). Behind each door is a short video about a feature in Svelte that you might not have heard about, or a useful tip on how to get the most out of the framework.

We're [kicking things off](https://advent.sveltesociety.dev/2025/1) with a demo of the [`$inspect(...)`](/docs/svelte/$inspect) rune. Check back every day for updates!
